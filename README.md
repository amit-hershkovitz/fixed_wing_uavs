Description
---
Driven by the defense, agriculture, and surveying sectors, the use of fixed-wing **U**nmanned **A**erial **V**ehicles (UAVs) has grown significantly in recent years. Alongside this rapid expansion, detecting fixed-wing aircraft in images or video streams has become essential for maintaining safe and efficient airspace operations. This capability plays a crucial role in preventing collisions, managing air traffic, ensuring security, and enhancing UAV coordination.

In the following project, a dataset of 735 unique fixed-wing UAVs images was collected and annotated. The dataset was used in order to train an object-detection deep learning model with YOLO architecture.
